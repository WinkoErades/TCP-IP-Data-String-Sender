# TCP-IP-Data-String-Sender
This Python script allows users to send a TCP/IP data string to a specified IP address and port. The data string can either be selected from a pre-existing list stored in a JSON file or manually entered by the user. If a new data string is entered, it will be automatically added to the JSON file, provided it doesn't already exist.
